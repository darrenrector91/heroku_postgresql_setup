# Heroku

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a Cloud Application Platform that will allow you to publish your apps to the web. We'll be primarily using Heroku in this class but it's important to note that there are many other companies out there that offer similar services.

Best of all, [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is free for development use! 

## Summary Steps

### Heroku Prerequisite

1. Sign up for an account on [Heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/)
2. Install Heroku CLI by typing `brew install heroku` in Terminal
  - [Additional installation notes and troubleshooting](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)
3. Authenticate by typing `heroku login` in Terminal

> Note: Your project also needs to have a git repository.

### Heroku Setup

Before you deploy, make sure your server `port` is configured correctly as:

```JavaScript
var port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
```

Run the following commands from within your project folder.

1. In terminal, navigate to your project folder and type `heroku create`
2. Login in if prompted
3. Type `git remote -v` to ensure it added successfully
4. In terminal, type `git push heroku master`
5. Our website is now live! However... we also have a database

### Postgresql on Heroku

1. In terminal, type `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev` to set up Postgresql on your Heroku project
2. Next, type `heroku pg:push your_database DATABASE_URL` to copy your database contents up to Heroku. `your_database` is the actual name of your database (e.g. `koala_holla_`). `DATABASE_URL` is a heroku config variable created by the Add On. Do not replace it with something else, just type: `DATABASE_URL`. For example, if you were deploying the `koala_holla` database, you should type `heroku pg:push kaola_holla DATABASE_URL`
3. Update or create a module for your pg-pool configuration to the following code that will convert the heroku `DATABASE_URL` into a pool config object. The only line you should have to change is `database: process.env.DATABASE_NAME || 'your_database'`. Change `your_database` to the actual name of your database. (e.g. `database: process.env.DATABASE_NAME || 'koala_holla'`:

**modules/pool.js**

```JavaScript
/**
* You'll need to use environment variables in order to deploy your
* pg-pool configuration to Heroku.
* It will look something like this:
**/

const pg = require('pg');
const url = require('url');
let config = {};

if (process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
  // Heroku gives a url, not a connection object
  // https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-pool
  let params = url.parse(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
  let auth = params.auth.split(':');

  config = {
    user: auth[0],
    password: auth[1],
    host: params.hostname,
    port: params.port,
    database: params.pathname.split('/')[1],
    ssl: true, // heroku requires ssl to be true
    max: 10, // max number of clients in the pool
    idleTimeoutMillis: 30000, // how long a client is allowed to remain idle before being closed
  };

} else {
  // only change the things on the right side of the ||
  config = {
    user: process.env.PG_USER || null, //env var: PGUSER
    password: process.env.DATABASE_SECRET || null, //env var: PGPASSWORD
    host: process.env.DATABASE_SERVER || 'localhost', // Server hosting the postgres database
    port: process.env.DATABASE_PORT || 5432, //env var: PGPORT
    database: process.env.DATABASE_NAME || 'your_database', //env var: PGDATABASE or the name of your database (e.g. database: process.env.DATABASE_NAME || 'koala_holla',)
    max: 10, // max number of clients in the pool
    idleTimeoutMillis: 30000, // how long a client is allowed to remain idle before being closed
  };
}

module.exports = new pg.Pool(config);
```

When you need a pool, use the following code:

```JavaScript
var pool = require('../modules/pool.js');
```

Next, commit your changes and push them to Heroku:

```
git add .
git commit -m "MESSAGE"
git push heroku master
```

> Note: You'll need to commit and push each time you make a change that you want to deploy to Heroku. Automatic deployments are covered in [a later section](#gui-and-automatic-deployment) **Keep in mind you CAN NOT pull from Heroku. This is not a replacement for GitHub!**

Lastly, open terminal and type `heroku open`, which should show you your deployed site!

> Note: It is best to fully test your code locally before deploying to Heroku. Bugs are much harder to troubleshoot on a live website.

### Miscellaneous

- `heroku logs` - Display error logs
- `heroku config` - Show basic app info
- `heroku restart` - Sometimes it helps to turn things off an on again
- `heroku open` - Opens the website for you project in the browser

## GUI and Automatic Deployment

The [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) website GUI can simplify several of the steps taken above especially for projects where you intend to make future changes.

1. In [your list of Heroku apps](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps), select your application.
2. Under the `Deploy` tab, in the `Deployment Method` section, select `Github`. Connect to the `Github` repository with your application by searching for the name of your repository.
3. In the `Manual Deploy` section, click `Deploy Branch` to deploy for the first time.

## Connect Postico to your Heroku Database

If you would like to edit your database, you can connect to your Heroku database directly from Postico. 

1. In [your list of Heroku apps](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps), select your application.
2. Under `Resources` or in the `Configure Add-Ons` section, select `Heroku Postgres`.
3. Select the `Settings` tab and click `View Credentials`
4. Open Postico and select `New Favorite`.
5. In the new Postico favorite, update the following to match Heroku:
  - Host
  - User
  - Database
  - Password
  - Port
6. Click `Connect` and you should have access to your database directly from Postico!
